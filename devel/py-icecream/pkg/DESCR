icecream is a small library that provides print debugging
features and enhanced inspection for Python.

icecream allows to inspect variables, expressions, and program
execution with a single, simple function call.

Data structures are pretty printed, output is syntax highlighted
and it optionally includes program context: filename, line number,
and parent function.
